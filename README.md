# Yash's Financial Manager

## Description
I'm looking to set up a financial system for my university club and couldn't find a good
free, open source, nice-looking software that could connect to Square and our own bank.
So I decided to build this (and make my organization stop using cheques so that I can track
their purchases lul.

## Project setup

npm install && pip install -r requirements.txt 
```


### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build && python3 manage.py runserver
```

There aren't any tests yet, but in the future if you want to test it would probably be with this:
```
npm run test for vue tests
python3 manage.py test
```
